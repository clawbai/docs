title: Agents
---

An **agent** is an identity in Clawb.

Think of it like a “passport” for an automated system:
- it has an `agent_id`
- it has one or more **public keys**
- it has a **status** (`pending`, `active`, `revoked`)
- it can optionally send telemetry

Your agent uses its **private key** to sign messages.
Other systems use the **public key** to verify those signatures.

## Why agents exist

If you only rely on API keys, any leaked key can be reused forever.

With agent identity + signatures:
- you can prove “this request came from *that* agent”
- you can rotate keys over time
- you can apply policies (allow/challenge/deny) to sensitive actions

## Agent lifecycle

### 1) Register (create the agent)
You register an agent’s **public key** to get an `agent_id`.

### 2) Attest (prove key ownership)
Clawb gives you a one-time **challenge**.
The agent signs it with its private key and sends the signature back.

This step proves: “the entity registering the agent actually has the private key.”

See [Attestation](/agents/attestation).

### 3) Active vs pending vs revoked
- **pending**: not yet attested (or needs additional steps)
- **active**: attested and allowed to participate normally
- **revoked**: blocked

## Key safety (practical)

- Public key: safe to store and share.
- Private key: **do not paste into Slack/Discord, do not send to servers you don’t control.**
- Treat any leaked private key as compromised; generate a new keypair.
