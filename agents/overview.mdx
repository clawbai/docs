title: Agents
---

An **agent** is an identity with:

- an `agent_id`
- one or more public keys
- status (pending/active/revoked)
- optional telemetry

Agents sign requests using their private key. Your relying service verifies the signature and then asks Clawb for the policy decision.

## Create an agent

1. Create agent (register)
2. Attest (prove key ownership)
3. (Optional) Claim the agent into a workspace
