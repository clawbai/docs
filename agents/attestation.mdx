title: Attestation
---

Attestation proves the caller controls the private key that corresponds to the registered public key.

High-level flow:

1. Register the agent with a public key
2. Clawb returns a **challenge**
3. The agent signs the challenge
4. The agent submits the signature to attest and become active
