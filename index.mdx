Clawb is the **bouncer for agent actions**.

When an agent asks your system to do something sensitive (refund money, deploy to prod, call a paid API), your backend asks Clawb for a decision:

- **allow** → proceed
- **challenge** → require extra proof (human approval, 2FA, business-hours rule, telemetry threshold, etc.)
- **deny** → block
