title: Vault
---

Clawb Vault is a secure place for humans and organizations to store **secrets** (API keys, tokens, passwords, certificates, and arbitrary environment variables) and let approved agents use them **without leaking the raw value**.

Think of it as:
- a **key/value store** for secrets (like a hosted `.env`)
- with **access grants** for agents
- with **auditing** for every access
- with optional **proxy/injection** so agents can call external APIs without ever seeing plaintext credentials

---

## What you can store
Vault is provider-agnostic. A secret is just a key/value pair.

Common patterns:
- **Single API key**
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY=...`
- **A “secret set” (remote env file)**
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=...`
  - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...`
  - `STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID=...`
- **Service-specific bundles**
  - AWS: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`
  - GitHub: `GITHUB_TOKEN`

## Core concepts

### Secret set
A **secret set** is a named collection of key/value entries.

Recommended naming:
- `provider`: `openai`, `stripe`, `github`, `custom`
- `environment`: `dev`, `staging`, `prod`
- `name`: `default`, `billing-bot`, `data-pipeline`

Example:
- `provider=stripe`, `environment=prod`, `name=billing-bot`

### Grants (who can use it)
A **grant** defines which agent(s) can use a secret set and under what constraints.

Typical grant constraints:
- allow specific **agents** only
- optional **allowlist** of keys inside the secret set
- allowed **actions** (recommended default: *proxy use*, not export)
- TTL (time bound permissions)
- optional rate/spend constraints (enforced when possible)

### Leases (capability tokens)
When an agent needs to use a secret set, Clawb issues a short-lived **lease**:
- **request-scoped** (single-use) — recommended default
- **workflow-scoped** (multi-use within constraints) — for long-running workflows

Leases are bound to:
- agent identity
- secret set
- permitted action(s)
- expiry (short TTL)

## Security model (high level)

### Encryption
- Secrets are encrypted **at rest**.
- Keys are rotated over time.
- Secrets are versioned (you can roll back safely).

### No-plaintext by default
By default:
- Vault APIs do **not** return plaintext secret values.
- Approved agent usage happens via **proxy/injection**.

### Auditing
Every relevant event is audited:
- secret set create/update/delete (soft delete)
- grant changes
- lease minting
- lease usage (secret accessed)

Audit logs are designed to be privacy-preserving:
- log *which keys were used* and *when*, not the secret values.

---

## Recommended default: proxy/injection (agents never see keys)
Instead of giving an agent a secret, Clawb can act as a **credential injection proxy**:

1) agent requests a lease to perform an action
2) agent sends the outbound request to Clawb (with the lease)
3) Clawb injects the secret server-side and forwards to the external provider

Benefits:
- agents can’t exfiltrate raw keys
- revocation is immediate
- auditing is straightforward
