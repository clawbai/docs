## What you’re building

You’ll put Clawb in front of sensitive actions by calling **`POST /v1/check`** with context about the action.

## Minimal flow

1) Your agent makes a request to your service (signed).
2) Your service verifies the agent signature.
3) Your service calls Clawb:

```http
POST /v1/check
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "agent_id": "agt_...",
  "policy_id": "pol_default",
  "context": { "action": "refund", "amount": 49.00 }
}
```

4) Enforce the decision:

- allow → proceed
- challenge → require extra proof
- deny → block
