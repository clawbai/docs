title: Challenges & approval links
---

Some `/v1/check` responses return `decision: "challenge"`.

A **challenge** means: “don’t proceed automatically — require an extra step.”

## Challenge lifecycle (v1)

1. Your service calls `/v1/check`
2. If the response is `challenge`, your service **must not execute** the sensitive action
3. Your service presents the user/operator with the `challenge` instructions (usually a URL)
4. After the challenge is satisfied, your service re-attempts the action (and re-calls `/v1/check`)

## Approval-link security model

Some challenges use “approval links” (magic URLs) as a lightweight human-in-the-loop mechanism.

Security properties:

- **Anyone with the link can approve/deny**
- therefore, treat approval links like passwords:
  - do not post them publicly
  - do not log them to shared logs
  - prefer short expirations
  - send via trusted channels

If you need stronger guarantees (who approved, multi-party approvals, etc.), you should build a stronger workflow on top (e.g., authenticated dashboard sessions).
