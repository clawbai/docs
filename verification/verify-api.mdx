title: Verification API (v1)
---

This page describes the provider-facing Verification API.

Goal: help API providers answer “should I trust this agent request?”

---

## Auth
Providers use a paid **provider API key**.

```http
Authorization: Bearer prv_...
```

---

## Verify an agent request (online)

```http
POST /v1/verify
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer prv_...

{
  "signed_request": {
    "method": "POST",
    "path": "/v1/refunds",
    "timestamp": "2026-02-11T20:11:12Z",
    "nonce": "n_123",
    "body_hash": "sha256:...",
    "agent_id": "agt_...",
    "signature": "base64:...",
    "key_id": "key_..."
  }
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "valid_signature": true,
  "agent": {
    "agent_id": "agt_...",
    "revoked": false,
    "verification_tier": "verified"
  },
  "reputation": {
    "risk_tier": "low",
    "reputation_band": "established",
    "signals_summary": {
      "window_days": 30,
      "success_rate": 0.992,
      "policy_violations": 0
    }
  },
  "owner": {
    "org": {
      "id": "org_...",
      "name": "Acme Inc"
    },
    "human": {
      "id": "hum_...",
      "display_name": "Jane Doe"
    }
  },
  "disclosure": {
    "org_disclosed": true,
    "human_disclosed": true
  },
  "response_signature": {
    "key_id": "clawb_key_...",
    "signature": "base64:..."
  }
}
```

Notes:
- `owner` fields may be omitted when disclosure is disabled.
- Providers should not treat omitted identity as a failure.
- `response_signature` lets you verify the response is authentic.

---

## Offline verification (optional)
For low-latency or high-volume integrations, agents can include an **assertion token** (JWT-like) that providers can validate locally.

Recommended approach:
- validate the token signature using Clawb’s public keys
- enforce short expirations
- optionally call `/v1/verify` for revocation checks or higher-risk operations

---

## Error modes
Expected errors:
- `401` invalid provider API key
- `429` rate limited
- `400` malformed signed request
- `200` with `valid_signature=false` for signature failures (recommended to avoid info leaks)

---

## Provider feedback (reputation signals)
Providers can submit feedback to improve ecosystem safety.

```http
POST /v1/reputation/feedback
Authorization: Bearer prv_...
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "agent_id": "agt_...",
  "signal": "abuse_suspected",
  "severity": "high",
  "evidence": {
    "request_ids": ["..."],
    "notes": "credential stuffing pattern"
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-02-11T20:11:12Z",
  "signature": "base64:..."
}
```

Clawb rate-limits and attributes feedback, and uses it as an input signal for reputation.
