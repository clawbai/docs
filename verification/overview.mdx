title: Agent Verification Service
---

Clawb offers a paid **Agent Verification Service** for API providers.

When an agent sends a request to your API, you can verify:
- the request was signed by a real agent identity
- the agent is not revoked
- the agent’s reputation/risk tier
- (optionally) the human/org behind the agent, if disclosure is enabled

This is designed to be easy to adopt:
- call an online endpoint (`/v1/verify`)
- or validate an offline assertion token locally (optional)

---

## What providers get
A verification response is **policy-aware**:

Always available:
- `valid_signature`
- `agent_id`
- `verification_tier`
- `risk_tier`
- `revoked` (true/false)

Conditionally available (depends on user/org disclosure settings):
- `org` identity
- `human` identity

---

## Disclosure policy (default: allow)
Clawb defaults to disclosing the owner identity **unless** the human/org hides it.

Controls:
- org/workspace default
- per-agent override
- per-provider override

Providers should treat missing identity fields as: “not disclosed”, not “unknown”.

---

## Pricing / access
The Verification Service is paid.

Providers authenticate with a **provider API key** and receive:
- quotas
- rate limits
- usage metrics
